    <h1>Alan Turing: The Father of Modern Computing</h1>
    <section>
      <p>Alan Turing was a British mathematician and logician who is widely considered to be the father of modern computer
        science. His work during World War II in breaking the German Enigma code was critical to the Allied victory.
        Turing's theoretical work laid the foundations for computer science, particularly the concept of the Turing
        machine, a fundamental model of computation.</p>
